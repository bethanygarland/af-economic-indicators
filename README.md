### <span style="color:red">Africa's Growing Economy</span>

Back in 2010 McKinsey released 'Lions on the Move', a report predicting that Africa would generate as 
much as $2.6 trillion in revenue by 2020. It started to become very popular with investors, who found that 
returns in emerging markets could generate up to three times the return than those in Western Economies. 
Many experts dubbed Africa's expected growth as the new Southeast Asia and predicted the kind of rapid industrialisation we saw there. A comibination of fluctuating commodity markets, political factors and currency instability has meant that it is hasn't quite taken off as expected. However, there is still a lot to be excited about. About half of the world’s fastest-growing economies in recent years have been located in Africa, 
with 20 economies expanding at an average annual rate of 5% or higher over the next five years, that's
faster than the 3.6% rate for the global economy. Africa is still the world's second fastest growing continent.

This report explores Africa's often mystifying growth using a dataset of various economic indicators from 1980 all the way up to 
2020 predictions.

#### What Is GDP?
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. As a broad measure of overall domestic production, it functions as a comprehensive scorecard of the country’s economic health.

#### What Is Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the value of all goods and services produced by an economy in a given year, expressed in base-year prices, and is often referred to as "constant-price," "inflation-corrected" GDP, or "constant dollar GDP." Unlike nominal GDP, real GDP accounts for changes in price levels and provides a more accurate figure of economic growth.

#### GDP Formula Based on Spending
The expenditure approach, also known as spending approach, calculates the spending by the different groups that participate in the economy. This approach can be calculated using the following formula: GDP = C + G + I + NX, or (consumption + government spending + investment + net exports). All these activities contribute to the GDP of a country.
