# African Economic Indicators

### <span style="color:red">Africa's Growing Economy</span> 

This repository is part of an introductory Python project set by General Assembly for their [Python Programming course.](https://generalassemb.ly/education/python-programming). It explores Africa's often mystifying growth utilising a dataset collected by the African Development Bank Group. The dataset forms a collection of economic indicators from 1980 all the way up to 2020 predictions. \

The data is mainly focused around different measurements of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the various factors that may contribute to GDP, as well as other measures such as Inflation. It covers the majority of countries and regions in Africa. \

#### What Is GDP?
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. As a broad measure of overall domestic production, it functions as a comprehensive scorecard of the countryâ€™s economic health.

#### What Is Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the value of all goods and services produced by an economy in a given year, expressed in base-year prices, and is often referred to as "constant-price," "inflation-corrected" GDP, or "constant dollar GDP." Unlike nominal GDP, real GDP accounts for changes in price levels and provides a more accurate figure of economic growth.

#### GDP Formula Based on Spending
The expenditure approach, also known as spending approach, calculates the spending by the different groups that participate in the economy. This approach can be calculated using the following formula: GDP = C + G + I + NX, or (consumption + government spending + investment + net exports). All these activities contribute to the GDP of a country.
